# Shmup Cup

A modern TypeScript 2D horizontal-scrolling shoot-'em-up in the spirit of **Gradius III** and **Darius Twin** —
retro SNES-era look, fast and fluid 60 fps gameplay — targeting **Samsung Tizen** (TVs / Smart Monitors, Tizen 5.5+),
with the browser and Electron as additional targets.

**Status:** research & planning. No game code yet.

## Documents

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| [`shmup_feat.md`](shmup_feat.md) | Feature & functionality catalog (P0/P1/P2), design decisions, reference data from both source games |
| [`shmup_tech.md`](shmup_tech.md) | Language/platform verdict, Tizen 5.5 constraints, test-hardware notes, library comparisons, recommended stack |
| [`input_probe_spec.md`](input_probe_spec.md) | Spec for the first spike: a diagnostic Tizen app that measures the Samsung remote / gamepad / display behavior |

## Key decisions so far

- **Language:** TypeScript, shipped as a Tizen web app (`.wgt`).
- **Target:** Tizen 5.5+ (Chromium 69). Test hardware: 2× Samsung Smart Monitor M7 43" (LS43AM702UNXZA, M70A).
- **Primary controller:** the Samsung Smart Remote (gamepad & keyboard also supported).
- **No UI framework** (no React/Vue) in the game — canvas-drawn UI. Vite is the build tool.
- **Recommended stack:** PixiJS v8 (renderer only) + custom fixed-step deterministic loop, custom input/audio/collision, Vite + TypeScript + Vitest, Electron for desktop.

## Next step

Build the input probe (`tools/input-probe/`, see [`input_probe_spec.md`](input_probe_spec.md)) on the **Windows desktop**
that sits on the same LAN as the monitors and holds the Samsung certificate profile.

Desktop prerequisites: Git, Node 20+, Tizen Studio **or** VS Code + Samsung Tizen extension (with a Samsung certificate
profile whose distributor cert includes both monitors' DUIDs), monitors in Developer Mode pointing at the desktop's IP.
